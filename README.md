🌦️ Weather Forecasting Web Application

A modern weather forecasting web application that provides real-time weather data based on user-searched locations. The application consumes a third-party weather REST API to fetch live weather information and displays it through a clean, responsive user interface.

🚀 Features

Real-time temperature and weather conditions

Displays humidity, wind speed, and weather status

Responsive UI for mobile and desktop devices

Dynamic UI updates based on API responses

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript

Styling: CSS / UI component library

API: Third-party Weather REST API (OpenWeather)

Tools: Node.js, npm

⚙️ How It Works (Developer Perspective)

User enters a city name

Application sends an asynchronous request to the weather API

API returns real-time weather data

React updates the UI dynamically using state management

Data is rendered in a structured and readable format

This project focuses on API integration, asynchronous data handling, and component-based UI architecture.
